## Migration Notes

Initial site being based on a website template purchased on TemplateMonster, pointedly to give the apearanace of a professional website
that was tossed up in a hurry. Over time it will be moved to a more modern looking site. All part of the narative flow.

### Current state
- `/src/assets/template/` are assets from the original template
